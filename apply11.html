		<h1>How to Build Good Credit</h1>
	</header>

	<main>
		<p>If you ever hope to get a home loan or auto loan, you’ll need good credit. Many landlords even require good credit to rent an apartment. It’s great if you want to stay far away from debt today—but someday you’ll find it’s better to have the credit and not need it than to need it and not have it. An excellent way to start building credit is to apply for a starter credit card, designed for people new to credit. If you’re a full-time college student, try starting with a student credit card. These cards are designed to approve students and you can upgrade them when you graduate. Some lenders offer credit-builder loans—small personal loans designed for anyone new to credit. They’ll help you build credit, but come at a cost. If you ever hope to get a home loan or auto loan, you’ll need good credit. Many landlords even require good credit to rent an apartment.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Secure a credit card or small loan</li>
			<li>Do not lend more than you can comfortably pay back</li>
			<li>Pay back the debt on or before its due time</li>
		</ul>
